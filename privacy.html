  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    At BookNest, we respect and protect your privacy. When you sign in with eBay through our application,
    we only request the information necessary to manage your listings and inventory. We do not sell,
    share, or disclose your personal data to third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information collected during the eBay sign‑in process is used solely to authenticate your account
    and enable BookNest features. We store access tokens securely and never retain your eBay password.
  </p>
  <p>
    BookNest uses secure HTTPS connections to protect your data in transit. You remain in control of
    your eBay account at all times, and you may revoke access through eBay’s account settings whenever
    you choose.
